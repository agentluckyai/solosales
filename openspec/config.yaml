  Known components (verify per change):
  - Prisma migrations exist
  - BullMQ queue exists
  - Docker / docker compose used for local infra

  Engineering constraints:
  - Prefer boring, stable implementations.
  - DB changes must include: data-safe migration + rollback plan.
  - Queue/worker changes must be idempotent (safe to retry).
  - Cross-platform paths: use Node.js path module; never hardcode separators.

rules:
  proposal:
    - Keep it 1–2 pages and decision-oriented.
    - Always include a short "Non-goals" subsection if there is any ambiguity.
  specs:
    - Specify observable behavior and edge cases; avoid implementation details.
  design:
    - Must include: data flow, failure cases, and rollback.
  tasks:
    - Break down into small, reviewable steps; include verification steps.
